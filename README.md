# 👋 Hey, I'm Sumanth Nallandhigal

I'm a **DevOps and Cloud Engineer** passionate about building automation-driven, scalable cloud infrastructures.

Currently focusing on **AWS Partner solutions**, **Terraform module development**, and **CI/CD pipelines** that power startups and enterprise platforms.

## ⚙️ What I Do

I specialize in bridging the gap between **DevOps**, **Cloud Engineering**, and **FinOps Automation** — helping teams build resilient, secure, and cost-efficient systems.

- 🧩 Automating infrastructure with **Terraform**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes**
- 🚀 Creating reusable **AWS Terraform modules** for startups
- 🔐 Applying **DevSecOps** best practices (Trivy, SonarQube, Checkov)
- 📊 Implementing **cost governance** and cloud automation (FinOps)
- 💡 Delivering **monitoring**, **alerts**, and **performance optimization**
- 🤝 Collaborating with cross-functional teams to improve release velocity and cloud reliability
